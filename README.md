# SSNS
**S**imple **S**tochastic and **N**onlinear **S**imulator, a web app

* interface with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) so that app is easy to use from both mobile and desktop browsers
* plotting relies on the [flot library](https://www.flotcharts.org/), or, for heatmaps, the native HTML canvas element
* web typesetting is done using the [KaTeX library](https://www.katex.org/)
* dependencies include:

### Classes, Hierarchies, etc.
The following classes, which are roughly listed from "largest" (i.e., "outermost") to "smallest," are not part of large class hierarchies, and are often present only as a single instance:

* <samp>SSNS</samp> = **S**imple **S**tochastic and **N**onlinear **S**imulator
* <samp>UserInterface</samp>
* <samp>PlottingMachinery</samp>
* <samp>RunState</samp>
* <samp>UINI</samp> = **U**ser **I**nterface **N**umerical **I**nput
* <samp>HelpViewerNode</samp>
* <samp>HelpViewer</samp>

A few notes:

* <samp>SSNS</samp>, as the name suggests, is the JavaScript class that encompasses all app logic.  It is instantiated between a pair of <samp>script</samp> tags at the very end of [<samp>SSNS.html</samp>](SSNS.html)
* <samp>HelpViewer</samp> is a modal-lightbox-based network of help pages, each corresponding to a <samp>HelpViewerNode</samp>; see the [Help Viewer](#help-viewer) section for details and a "sitemap" of node pages.

### Input/Output

Input to the app is done only via the user interface.  On loading of the page, the app shows the default system type and plots its trajectory.  At that point, the trajectory consists of only a single time point &mdash; the default initial condition &mdash; so pressing "play" will do nothing!  More trajectory must be generated by pressing "record."  Once there are two or more time steps, record/backward-play/pause/forward-play, as well as other trajectory navigation commands, become possible.  (This behavior may be confusing if the user expects something like a music player, while the app is more like an audio recorder.)

In addition to the buttons, checkboxes, and radio button selectors, the app has many text input fields for passing in numbers.  Each is input field "block" has a label with symbol/word on a colored background to the left of the input field itself.  Some blocks also have a dedicated "apply" button or related controls to the right.  Each input field uses an HTML <samp>input</samp> element with <samp>type="number"</samp> under the hood.  Note that the presence of small increment/decrement arrows, the popup of numeric keyboards, etc. will all vary by browser and mobile/desktop.

Outputting trajectory data is not implemented, nor planned, but would be very doable... either saving to disk through the browser or just opening a new tab with text data.  And screenshots are always possible, of course ðŸ˜€.  Similarly, reading saved trajectory in from disk is neither implemented nor planned.
