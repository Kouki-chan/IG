The PlotType hierarchy is straightforward.  In the intermediate level, each of the 4 plot types (XT, HX, HM, and PP) extend the root node base class PlotType with names of the form PlotTypeHM.  Then each system type that implements a given plot type extends the corresponding intermediate class.  For example, the Moran model, with abbreviation MN, implements both XT and HX plot types, so we have both PlotTypeXT_MN and PlotTypeHX_MN.  See the help pages and the code comments for more info.
